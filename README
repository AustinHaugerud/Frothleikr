Frothleikr
------------------

Frothleikr is a tiny serialization library I wrote for my own personal needs, due to how
I often times found myself rewriting the same code for writing data
in binary forms while retaining portability. 

The library is very small and lightweight, and is very simple to use.

What It Does Do
-----------------

-Easily create portable in memory serializations of integer types with your choice of endianness 

-Easily create portable in memory serializations of IEEE754 floating point types with your choice of endianness

-Easily store your serialized data into in memory buffers

What It Does NOT Do
--------------------

-Serialize to non-memory targets. This means it doesn't handle file io, sending data through networks etc.
This shouldn't be a problem for you unless you're looking for a more high level library. Once your
data has been serialized in memory, it's a simple matter of just passing the bytes along to
whatever your target is. 

-Serialize complex types. This library is more of a serialization assitance library, than an actual
serialization library. It makes handling primitives much more simple. When it comes to serializing
your own complex types however, that is up to you. 

Building
-------------------
Get Cmake (if you don't already have it)
Use Cmake
Use whatever Cmake generated.
Profit

The library should be able to be compiled as C and C++.
No depedencies needed.

Final Note
-------------------
It's important to recognize that this library is not feature heavy. It's very basic and does
no more than what it says it does. 

By looking at that the examples you should be able to quickly grasp how to use this library.
